# OfficeNetwork
This is an office network design created using Cisco Packet Tracer which has eight departments, two server rooms, café and canteen to exchange information with one another through the network.
The following concepts have been used to design the office network:
•	Routing Protocols: Static Routing, RIP Routing, OSPF Routing and EIGRP Routing.
•	VLAN and VLAN Trunking Protocol
•	Network Address Translation (NAT): Port NAT and NAT Overload Translation.
•	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
•	Router on a stick
